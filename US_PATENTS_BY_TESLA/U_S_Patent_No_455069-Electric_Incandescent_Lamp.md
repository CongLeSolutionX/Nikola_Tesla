## Nikola Tesla's Electric Incandescent Lamp (U.S. Patent 455,069) üí°

**Inventor:** Nikola Tesla
**Patent Date:** June 30, 1891
**Source:** [Google Patents - US455069A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US455069A/en)

This invention describes a novel form of electric incandescent lamp where light is produced by the incandescence of carbon or other suitable refractory conductors. The key innovation lies in using **two isolated conductors** within a **very highly exhausted receiver (a "non-striking vacuum")** powered by currents of **very great frequency and very high potential**. This was markedly different from existing lamps.

**Manufacturing Notes for Fig. 1:**
1.  Assemble components as shown.
2.  Attach to vacuum pump.
3.  During exhaustion, bring carbons (G) to incandescence with a suitable current to bake fire-clay (F) and drive off occluded gases.
4.  Carry exhaustion to the "highest possible point" (non-striking vacuum).
5.  Seal off the globe at (H).
6.  *Precaution*: Insulate external conductors well to prevent current dissipation. Ends of carbons might be brought closer initially to allow sparks to leap between them, reducing injury risk before high vacuum is achieved.

## Lamp Construction: Figure 2 - Inductive Connection (Condenser Action) üîå‚ö°

This version employs an inductive connection using condenser (capacitor) principles, avoiding direct wired connections to the internal conductors from outside the main globe.

    end
```

**Operational Note for Fig. 2:**
Energy is transmitted from the external circuit (via O, O') to the internal conductors (G, G') through **condenser action**. The glass (B') acts as the dielectric between the internal (K, K') and external (O, O') coatings. Tesla notes: "no visible discharge or transfer of current from one to the other through the highly-rarefied medium between them." The incandescence is attributed to this condenser action with the specialized current.

        end
        
        Mechanism --> Output["Light Emission üí°"]

```

The "condenser action" is essentially the displacement current and the rapidly alternating electric field between the conductors G within the highly evacuated globe, induced by the high-frequency, high-potential source. The energy associated with this field causes the material of the conductors G to heat up to incandescence.

## Generation of High-Frequency, High-Potential Current ‚ö°üåÄ

Tesla mentions his system for producing these specialized currents, detailed in a separate application (No. 390,414). The description points to a resonant transformer circuit, a precursor to the Tesla Coil.

## Claims Summary üìú

The patent claims highlight the novelty:
1.  An incandescent lamp with **two isolated refractory conductors** in a **non-striking vacuum**, producing light by incandescence, each with a terminal.
2.  Combination: A globe exhausted to the **non-striking point**, two isolated refractory conductors for incandescence, and means to connect them to a power source.
3.  Combination for an incandescent lamp: Globe exhausted to non-striking point, sealed metallic wires, refractory body on each wire, with **insulation covering wires and non-incandescent parts** within the globe.
4.  Combination: Globe exhausted to non-striking point, sealed metallic wires, refractory conductor to each wire, insulating covering around wires/joint, and **refractory insulating body around conductors near the joint**.

---

In essence, Tesla's patent describes a sophisticated lamp system that relied on principles of high-frequency alternating currents and high vacuum technology, moving beyond the limitations of direct current incandescence and gas discharge lighting of the era. His work in this area was foundational for later developments in lighting and radio frequency technology. ‚ú®
